1. ### Project Title and Description : " Internet Movie Review Dataset "

### Descriptions of the project :
                   " The Internet Movie Reviews Dataset is a collection of movie reviews written by users, often sourced from platforms like IMDb. It’s designed to help researchers and developers to create and test models that can determine the emotional tone or sentiment of these reviews whether they are positive or a negative reviews. 
### Content: 
     It contains text reviews from users about movies, typically collected from platforms like IMDb.
### Feature: 
       The dataset usually contains a columns, for this dataset it can contains the feature that is reviews in text form, that represents the user's opinion about a movie.

### Size:
     The dataset may consist of thousands of labeled reviews for training, testing, and validating the different models."

### Goals of the project :
              " To build models capable of understanding and classifying the sentiment expressed in movie reviews. you can explore different NLP techniques like breaking down text into smaller parts like (tokenization), using word representations (embeddings), and figuring out the overall mood of a sentence (sentiment scoring). It’s all about helping AI better understand human language and emotions. "
